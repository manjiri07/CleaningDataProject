Codebook for average_data


This dataset gives the average values for the means and standard deviations of different accelerometer and gyroscope signals for each subject and each activity

The dataset has 180 entries: 30 subjects and 6 activities 

Following is the description of the first two variables:

subject: Identifies subject who performed the activity. Range is from 1 to 30
label: Training labels. Identify the activity performed by the subject. Values are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The remaining variables are a subset of the features vector from the original dataset.
The values were obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals. 
mean() indicates the mean value of the raw signals
std() indicates standard deviation of the datapoints in the raw signals
X,Y,Z are denote the direction of the particular signal 
Prefix 't' in the variable indicated that it is a time domain signal features
Prefix 'f' indicates that it is a frequency domain signal value 
For a more detailed explanation please refer to features_info.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset folder
